## Stakeholder-value matrix

In this assignment, you scraped Wikipedia, and limited yourself to webpages in Wikipedia.
But, there exist many databases of webpages scraped from the internet at large, not 
limited to Wikipedia. Some of these webpages include personal information, harmful or 
unpleasant content, misinformation, etc.

### Question 1: robots.txt

Search online for a file called robots.txt. What is the intention of this file? Is it enforced?

### Question 2: Stakeholder-value matrix

Please create a stakeholder-value matrix for a product which requires scraping the 
internet at large. Please include at least five stakeholders and at least five values.
Assume that the scraped data is being used for a product for users, such as a generative
AI model.

It is recommended (but not required) that one of the stakeholders be bloggers from more
than ten years ago, and that one of the values is avoiding intellectual property theft.
It will help you with the next question.


### Question 3: A conflict in the stakeholder-value matrix

Some people created online content a while ago, during a time when large generative
models were not a huge part of everyday life. What are some situations when the value of
avoiding intellectual property theft is de-prioritized for these stakeholders, in favor
of building the end product? For example, if the end product is a model that generates images,
what is a scenario in which these stakeholders' intellectual property rights are de-prioritized?

### Question 4: Other conflicts in the stakeholder-value matrix

Identify at least two other conflicts that arise from the stakeholder-value matrix. For each
conflict, discuss possible mitigations.
